## 🏗️ Architecture

The extension uses a **modular PowerPack system**:

```
src/
├── extension.ts          # Main entry point
└── packs/
    ├── core/             # "All Systems Go" Pack (always loaded)
    │   ├── index.ts      # Command registration
    │   └── contextMap.ts # Context Map logic
    ├── wordpress/        # WordPress Pack
    │   └── index.ts
    ├── elementor/        # Elementor Pack
    │   ├── index.ts
    │   └── auditor.ts    # Pre-Flight Audit logic
    └── woocommerce/      # WooCommerce Pack
        └── index.ts
```

Each PowerPack is self-contained and registers its own commands during activation.
